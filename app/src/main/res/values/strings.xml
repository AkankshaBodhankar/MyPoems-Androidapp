        \nWhen hurdles come your way\n
        and you feel like, going to bay!!\n
        when there\'s no,hand to hold,\n
        you just need to be, bold.\n
        When thy life tears you apart\n
        Be positive and try being smart.\n\n
        When there\'s, no clue of sunshine,\n
        Be determined-everything will be fine.\n
        Don\'t listen to the voices around,\n
        let only your thoughts rebound.\n\n
        Immerse deep into your mind,\n
        a ray of hope you will surely find.\n
        You are thy best pal you know,\n
        this time is to make you grow.\n
        Be patient O brave man!\n
        rise up to the world and say I can.

        Pollution Pollution everywhere,\n
        Causing alarming disasters,\n
        Inducing our mother earth in vain.\n
        We don\'t have any clue\n
        How much she has to bare in pain.\n
        The mesmerizing earth is ours to enjoy\n
        For every little girl and boy.\n
        Help to reuse,\n
        Help to reduce,\n
        All the trash which we put,\n
        In the dumping crane.\n
        The choice is ours\n
        To live like sane or insane,\n
        Don\'t think  much,\n
        Follow the rules of nature\n
        To save her from danger.\n

        I have never seen the stars twinkle\n
        For when the sky would be clear\n
        Staring the mysterious fire kites\n
        Lost in solitude with the sinister\n
        Just someone when there\'s none\n
        It always nurtures when,\n
        that beauty gestures\n
        And I know when I\'m lonely\n
        It\'s always the nature that holds me.\n\n

        I\'m waiting for those twinkles to twinkle\n
        which will brighten up my life\n
        Just so eager I have been\n
        to admire those fire angles.\n
        I would go beyond the limits\n
        to get a delightful glimpse,\n
        of those lifted lights\n
        floating and glittering,\n\n

        I don\'t know how will it be?\n
        Maybe like stars,\n
        rising up from the bottom\n
        Shrinking as they go beyond\n
        maybe like a fire fly ,\n
        ready to set free.\n
        It might be oh so perfect!!\n
        I don\'t know how will it be?
